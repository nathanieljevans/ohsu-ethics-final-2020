> **Title**: Ethical Considerations for Dataset Curation and Maintenance in Precision Oncology  

> **Abstract**: In recent years, there has been widespread drug screening and genetic profiling to characterize the pharmacogenetic landscape of cancers. These datasets have been made publicly available, and have become and integral part of ongoing precision oncology research. The impact and role of these datasets raises several ethical considerations worth addressing. In this paper, we consider the questions of (1) how research dependency on specific datasets might constrain research findings (2) the potential risk for treatment-marginalized genetic populations and (3) the role of data quality and maintenance and its relationship to dataset longevity, reproducible research and actionable research results.
